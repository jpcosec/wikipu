# Issues Guide — Software Design Cycle

This document defines the pluggable design cycle used to manage and resolve project issues. It has two stages: **Mapping** and **Indexing**.

---

## Stage 1 — Mapping

Produce one `.md` file per concern under:

- **`plan_docs/issues/gaps/`** — Things that exist but are wrong, inconsistent, or incomplete (duplicates, broken contracts, unresolved decisions, placeholders).
- **`plan_docs/issues/unimplemented/`** — Things explicitly designed in contracts, house rules, or agent instructions but not yet built.

Each issue file follows this format:

```
# <Title>

**Explanation:** What is wrong or missing, and why it matters.

**Reference:** File(s) in src/, wiki/, or agents/ where the issue lives.

**What to fix:** The concrete end state.

**How to do it:** Suggested implementation path.

**Depends on:** Other issue file path(s) this must wait for, or `none`.
```

## Stage 2 — Indexing

After mapping, run the indexing step before assigning any work. Five operations in order:

### 2.1 — Legacy Audit
Review each issue for content that should simply be deleted rather than fixed. If an old document has no place in the current architecture, record the decision as an ADR in `wiki/adrs/` and delete the file. There is no archive folder — that violates Law 1.

### 2.2 — Atomization
If an issue's "How to do it" section has more than 3–4 distinct steps that could fail independently, split it into child issues with explicit dependency links between them. The goal is that each issue can be handed to a subagent as a single, completable unit of work.

### 2.3 — Contradiction Check
Before drawing dependencies, scan all issues for internal contradictions:
- **Overlap:** Two issues proposing different fixes to the same file or component. Merge or split the scope so ownership is unambiguous.
- **Conflict:** Two issues whose "What to fix" sections would produce incompatible end states. One must be revised or marked as blocked by a design decision.
- **Circular dependency:** A `Depends on:` chain that loops back to itself. Break the cycle by extracting the shared concern into a new root issue.

Flag any contradiction explicitly in the affected issue files before proceeding to the dependency graph.

### 2.4 — Dependency Graph
Map every `Depends on:` link across all issue files into an explicit directed graph. Identify:
- **Roots** (no dependencies) — these are the starting phases
- **Parallelizable groups** — issues with no dependency on each other at the same depth can be solved concurrently by parallel subagents
- **Blockers** — issues that gate multiple downstream items

### 2.5 — Generate Index.md
Use the dependency graph to produce `plan_docs/issues/Index.md` from the seed template at `wiki/standards/issues_index_seed.md`. This file is the entrypoint for subagents. It must be regenerated whenever issues are added, split, or resolved.

---

## Lifecycle

Issue files are ephemeral (`plan_docs/` lifespan rules apply). Once an issue is solved:
1. Delete the issue file.
2. Remove it from `Index.md`.
3. Record lasting decisions in `wiki/adrs/` if the fix involved a design choice.

Do not accumulate resolved issues — that is what `git log` and `wiki/adrs/` are for.

# SLDB

Use `sldb` for StructuredNLDoc models and their Markdown documents.

When to use
- Any StructuredNLDoc-backed document that should roundtrip as structured data
- Any structured document change that needs model-level idempotency validation

What it does
- Extracts data from Markdown with a model
- Renders Markdown from data with a model
- Validates model roundtrip behavior
- Keeps field-level descriptions present so the model is self-explanatory to humans and LLMs

Model rule
- Every `StructuredNLDoc` field must use `Field(description="...")` with a non-empty description

Commands
- `sldb extract <model-ref> <input-markdown> <output-json-or-yaml>`
- `sldb render <model-ref> <input-data> <output-markdown>`
- `sldb validate <model-ref> --input <markdown>`
- `sldb validate <model-ref> --data <json-or-yaml>`
- `sldb validate <model-ref> --input <markdown> --pythonpath <project-path>`
- `sldb init [path]`

Python marker modes
- Safe mode is the default; `py` markers stay literal and are not evaluated
- Unsafe mode enables `py` marker evaluation for trusted templates only

Rule
- Every `StructuredNLDoc` field must have a meaningful description.
- For every StructuredNLDoc workflow, run `sldb validate` before finishing.

## Cross-Repo Usage

To reference models from another repo, set `PYTHONPATH` to the root of the repo containing the models:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/wikipu sldb validate myapp.docs:RecipeDoc --input recipe.md
```

Or pass `--pythonpath` explicitly:

```bash
sldb validate myapp.docs:RecipeDoc --input recipe.md --pythonpath /path/to/wikipu
```

## Example Bundle

A reference example lives in `sldb_example/`. Use:

```bash
sldb example
```

To unpack the reference bundle locally into a `sldb_example` directory.
